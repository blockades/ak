A common observation over the past few decades has been the rise of labour based on affect and creativity, our capacities to speak, emote and empathise. For philosophers and labour theorists, this trend is tied to an emphasis on the production of social relations and networks. The creative or affective labour paradigm is perhaps most strikingly clear in the worlds of art and business, worlds in which imagination and innovation reign, and the traversal of borders and disciplines is marketed as flexibility and independence. aladin walks through these worlds. A magician, artist, entrepreneur, banker, consultant, community worker and alchemist, he crosses and brings together multiple identities and high profile institutions. He is a creative worker par excellence, an example of the successful subject of contemporary capitalism.

This combination of magic, strategy and art of course throws into question the role and meaning of magic today. aladin offers a more complex narrative than what might be commonly expected. We might ask the question: what happens to magic once it is embedded in the languages of business and industry? Traditionally magic has been used to entertain, to beguile its audience, but also to trick and to hide. Magic, when set into the circuitry of the economy, is a chimera. It is comprised of so many different components, and is put to use in so many different contexts, that one hardly knows where it begins and ends. There is a beauty in this practice, as well as a danger. The radical potential of magic lies precisely in its ability to evade capture. In this sense, magic might be seen as a method of flight, both away from one state and toward another. At the same time, magic’s mutability is a symptom of the way that languages, ideas, practices and relationships are put into use for capital, exoticised and fetishised as novel others with high surplus value.

For aladin, a man whose external biography is unashamedly comprised of secondary sources and rumours, magic is one means to achieve what he desires, which is to make a change. In this sense magic retains some of its old function: to open ways of being and seeing the world up to chance and to new perspectives. Perhaps the magic that aladin invokes is nothing less than fitting for the contexts in which he moves, holding open the tension between aesthetics and economics.
