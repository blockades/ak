Text: 

> At the time, it didn’t seem like something worth talking about. We were sitting together in a hangar-like room in a warehouse. It was blusteryoutside and cold inside. We were at a meeting of a new collective to organise an upcoming demonstration, launching a campaign with casual service workers. The chairs were set up in a ring, you could see the faces of everyone around you – some you knew, others were unfamiliar. Everyone was sizing each another up. One by one, people began to introduce themselves. One by one the voices echoed around our ears. Some of them were confident, full of pep and verve, words tumbling all over themselves with enthusiasm. Some stuttered into the air, pausing and racing, staccato, nervous. Others were drawn out and understated. Some filled the space while others seemed swallowed up by it. And then, suddenly, it stopped. One person said nothing at all. A pause. Waiting. Nothing. And in that moment the room reconfigured itself around the memory of our voices, and the silence.

The experience in the room that day, an experience that I have had in some form or another in many rooms and in many meetings, shows both the way in which how we speak and listen is political, and the way in which voice and space co-create one another. The voice, or lack thereof, is the most immediate means of expression; indeed, ‘affective and ethico-political forces are firstly expressed by the voice’.[^1]  The voice, in its expression of affective and ethico-political forces, creates worlds. ie utterances of speakers open up spaces for different ways of being through dialogue: through their anticipation of a response.[^2] The ways that voices are shaped by, and shape, worlds and spaces, reveals the creative and constitutive operations of speech and language. !is understanding looks to the voice, and speech, as more than a conduit for the transfer of information. Emphasised from this view is not only the reciprocal and active process of creating worlds and meanings, but also the extra-linguistic elements of communication: the soundings, gestures and affective transmissions that make up our different relations.

By tuning into these affective and auditory elements, we may imagine an acoustic politics of the voice, whereby sound helps us to engage in, and elaborate upon, contemporary globalised political landscapes. Such a politics might help us to become more attuned to the ways in which voices are produced by, and productive of, relations, geographies and subjectivities. These are tied to projections and positions of class, race, education, culture, social value, sexuality and so forth. Unlike ideas of communication that see the speaker as active, and the listener as passive, we come to understand that as listeners we actively contribute to the spaces that utterances compel. We further see how such aspects play out in the sonic infections of the voice, not only in their linguistic content, through paying particular attention to pace, accent and dialect, intonation, frequency, amplitude, and silence. !e ways that these play out affect our capacity to listen and to respond to one another. If we are seeking to build relations alternative to those typical of capitalism, developing sensitivities to how we might speak and listen differently is crucial because they can help us to find ways to relate to ourselves and others differently, with care and with generosity.

Several recordings accompany this piece and you are invited to listen to them as you read the text; they are available here: soundcloud.com/anja_k/sets/a-sonic-geography-of-voice. By bringing these different voices into relation, I extend a desire for more convivial and caring practices of listening.[^3] Two kinds of
sound recording are heard: firstly, recordings of speech and sound phenomena taken from a variety of archives that directly illustrate the sonic qualities spoken about. The second of each recording is a compilation of short recordings with friends involved in radical political organising, coming from campaigns around feminism, migration, labour, gender and queer politics, permaculture and education struggles in the UK, Germany and Australia. Within much of this kind of organisation there is some awareness of how we speak to each other, the vocabularies we use and the articulations of privilege that underlie our speech. The recordings of friends involved in such organisations all address the question: in a collective meeting how does pace/ accent/ intonation/ frequency and pitch/ volume and silence affect your own capacity to listen and to respond?

Like a refrain, these reflections invite us to return to different perspectives around speaking and listening; through their sensual operation they add a further layer of sonic experience reminding us to be attentive to the qualities of the speaking voices themselves, and to think about our own responses in this process.
