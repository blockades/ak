his article investigates the claim of body artists who produced work in
California in the 1960s and 1970s that their specific mode of
perfonnance overcame the mimetic characteristics conventionally associated
with the arts. According to these artists (and associated theorists), this was
achieved through immediacy and corporeal presence - components
considered integral to body art in general. By sharing a common focus on the
flesh and the corporeal frame as the potential site of the merging between art
and life, Califomian body artists from this period examined the traditional
binary divisions of life/art and presence/absence via the idea of the body as
both subject and object of their art. Through an examination of work of key
artists such as Chris Burden {Shoot and Bed Piece), Linda Montano {Living
with Pauline Oliveros in the Desert for Ten Days), Lynn Hershman {Roberta
Breitmore), Dennis Oppenheim {Reading Position for Second Degree Bum),
and Tom Marioni {The Act of Drinking Beer with Friends is the Highest
Form of Art), I aim to assert that although Califomian body artists claimed
they overcame these traditional divisions, their approach did nothing more
than reinstate the very binaries they sought to negate.
